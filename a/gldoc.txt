glActiveShaderProgram
glActiveShaderProgram — set the active program object for a program pipeline object

C Specification
void glActiveShaderProgram(	GLuint pipeline,
GLuint program);
Parameters
pipeline
Specifies the program pipeline object to set the active program object for.

program
Specifies the program object to set as the active program pipeline object pipeline.

Description
glActiveShaderProgram sets the linked program named by program to be the active program for the program pipeline object pipeline. The active program in the active program pipeline object is the target of calls to glUniform when no program has been made current through a call to glUseProgram.

Errors
GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if pipeline is not a name previously returned from a call to glGenProgramPipelines or if such a name has been deleted by a call to glDeleteProgramPipelines.

GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if program refers to a program object that has not been successfully linked.
