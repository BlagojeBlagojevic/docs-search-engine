Lives in Greece (1993–present)1h
Are Greeks upset because Albanians and Macedonians won them independence?
On the contrary, we are not upset at all. We are laughing because people like you are misrepresenting reality. The Albanians did not win Greece its independence. Foreign powers intervened and Greece got its independence.

And to be entirely correct Greeks along with Orthodox Arvanites fought against the Albanian Muslims who were hired by the Ottomans to fight against Greeks and Arvanites. So if Arvanites were Albanians, the Albanian Muslims took money to kill their own blood.

Greek Macedonians rebelled in Macedonia, but they were not successful like their compatriots in the south.

Let’s move forward in time about 80 years. Who removed the Ottoman empire from Macedonia? Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbians without Albanian help. In fact if the Great powers did not insist, there would be no Albania today.

You need a few history lessons

Why do more people in Slovenia speak fluent Italian compared to those in Italy who speak fluent Slovenian?
People, in average, are pursuing success and lucrative opportunities. Italy is much bigger than Slovenia, so in Italy are more potential business opportunities and - to be honest - there is also more culture to study (literature, music, et cetera). Myself, a proper Slovenian, took Italian language co…
